# interface accepts multiple interface/port combinations. However, due to the
# dual stack nature of linux if you specify "[::]:1965" linux will also listen
# on "0.0.0.0:1965" so if you manually specify both it will fail.
# interface = [ "0.0.0.0:1965, "[::]:1965" ]
interface = [ "[::]:1965" ]
# port and host have been deprecated in favor of interface but will still work
# for now.
# port = 1965
# host = "::"
# log is optional and server wide. It defaults to info if not set. Other levels
# are error, warn, and info. If error is set it will only show error. If warn
# is set it will show error and warn. Info shows all three.
log = "info"
